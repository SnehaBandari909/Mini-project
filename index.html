        <p>Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized 
           by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on 
           the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. 
           Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii)
           and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). Some sources extend 
           the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of 
           Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. 
           Shark-like chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), 
           though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician (458–444 million years ago).
           The earliest confirmed modern sharks (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic around 200 million years ago, 
           with the oldest known member being Agaleus, though records of true sharks may extend back as far as the Permian.</p>

        <p>A deer (pl.: deer) or true deer is a hoofed ruminant ungulate of the family Cervidae (informally the deer family). 
            Cervidae is divided into subfamilies Cervinae (which includes, among others, muntjac, elk (wapiti), 
            red deer, and fallow deer) and Capreolinae (which includes, among others reindeer (caribou), 
            white-tailed deer, roe deer, and moose). Male deer of almost all species (except the water deer), 
            as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. These antlers are bony extensions of the skull 
            and are often used for combat between males.</p>

        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. 
            It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, 
            mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, 
            though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

            Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed 
            forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the 
            Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.</p>
